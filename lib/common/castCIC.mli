(** Telescopic substitution of values for free variables in a list of terms. 
    For instance, the values of an inductive or a constructor and the declared
    parameter and argument types, such as in `cons Bool ...`:
    - cons types: (A : Type) (hd : A) (tl : list A)
    - values : Bool ... 
    - result : [Type, Bool, list Bool]
    Raises an error if the values and the list of terms have different sizes.

    rest of the list.
